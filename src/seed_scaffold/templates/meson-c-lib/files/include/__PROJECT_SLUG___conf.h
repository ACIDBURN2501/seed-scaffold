/**
 * @file {{PROJECT_SLUG}}_conf.h
 * @brief Public configuration header for {{PROJECT_NAME}}.
 *
 * @details
 *    This header provides configuration options for the {{PROJECT_SLUG}} module.
 *    It is included automatically by {{PROJECT_SLUG}}.h, but applications may
 *    also include it directly before {{PROJECT_SLUG}}.h to keep configuration in
 *    one place. Default values are provided if not overridden.
 *
 * @note
 *    Override any configuration option by defining it before including
 *    this file. Example:
 *    @code
 *    #define {{PROJECT_UPPER}}_MAX 1000000.0f
 *    #include "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}_conf.h"
 *    #include "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}.h"
 *    @endcode
